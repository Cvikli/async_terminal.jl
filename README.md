Run @async BUT in terminals. 

# How?
```julia
@aync_tty [`tty`,[`echo "haha whut"`, `tty`, `echo "I am on the machine"`, `echo "hell"`], `echo "We are rocking!"`]
```
This runs 3 terminal with the specified commands.

# Why?
I needed this to open several terminal and see the output continuously of different runs. 

# Caveats
There is a slight chance that if you simultaneously open a terminal when the call "reserve" the terminal sessions, then the code can take ownership of your terminal and run the commands in your just opened terminal. But this is really like 0.0001s when those terminal opens at the calls.
